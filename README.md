# The Jekyll Gallery experiment

The Jekyll Gallery is a complete gallery / slideshow solution. This is me trying to do something usefull for static websites.

Create a gallery or slideshow to show your pictures to the world or to embed it in a website. Host it on Github Pages for free.

[Here is a demo](http://lexoyo.me/jekyll-gallery/).

At the core of this gallery there is work from other people:

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [JQuery lightSlider](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightslider/)

## user guide

1. Fork this repo with the button in the upper right corner of this page
2. Edit the file `_galleries/my-pics1.md` with [Prose, a visual editor which plugs into Github](http://prose.io/), add images in the list and save the file
3. Check the changes on `http://yourgithubusername.github.io/jekyll-gallery/`
